# Project - Cybersecurity Roadmap/Plan for Lattitude Board Member
Developing a cybersecurity roadmap for Latitude Financial Services using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to enhance resilience against cyber threats.

## What have been done
- Assessed Latitude Financial Services' security posture post-2023 data breach.
- Developed a cybersecurity roadmap following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
- Identified, protected, detected, responded, and recovered using structured security measures.
- Integrated risk assessments, access controls, vendor management, incident response, and recovery strategies.

## Impact
- Strengthened access control mechanisms reducing unauthorized access risks.
- Improved vendor risk management reducing supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Implemented real-time detection and response reducing incident response time.
- Enhanced data encryption and backup solutions improving business continuity.
- Increased cybersecurity awareness and employee training reducing human-related security risks.


## Introduction
Cybersecurity threats pose increasing risks to businesses. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a structured approach to managing these risks. This report outlines a cybersecurity roadmap for Latitude Financial Services, leveraging the NIST framework to mitigate threats effectively.

### About Latitude Financial Services
On March 8, 2023, Latitude Financial Services suffered a data breach impacting 7.9 million customers. The attack exploited a vulnerability in a third-party vendor's software. This roadmap outlines strategies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

### About the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This roadmap tailors these principles to Latitude’s cybersecurity needs.

## The Cybersecurity Roadmap/Plan

### Identify
The first step in the cybersecurity roadmap/plan is to identify the organization's assets, systems, and data that are critical to its operations and easily exposed to possible vulnerabilities. The priority of assets is sorted by their criticality as follows:

- Customer data: Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information (PII).
- Financial data: Account numbers, transaction records, and financial information of customers, including linked bank details.
- Intellectual property: Trade secrets, patents, and proprietary information.
- Business-critical systems: CRM, financial reporting, and operational systems.
- Sensitive information: Security plans, employee records, and confidential stakeholder data.

Additionally, Latitude should conduct risk assessments to evaluate vulnerabilities from past cybersecurity events. The risk assessment should focus on:

- Likelihood of unauthorized access.
- Impact of breaches on customer data and financial information.
- Effectiveness of existing security controls (access control, MFA, least privilege access).
- Specific risks such as phishing, social engineering, brute force attacks, and credential stuffing.

By identifying these risks, Latitude can prioritize its security efforts and take proactive steps to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Protect
To safeguard the organization's critical assets, the following measures should be implemented:

- **Access Control:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and regular access audits.
- **Vendor Management:** Assess third-party security measures and enforce cybersecurity compliance.
- **Patch Management:** Regular vulnerability scanning, prioritization, and testing.
- **Data Encryption:** Secure sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct regular cybersecurity training for employees.

### Detect
Real-time threat detection ensures timely identification of security incidents:

- Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions.
- Implement anomaly detection mechanisms.
- Conduct asset and network scanning for vulnerabilities.

### Respond
Incident response strategies should focus on containment and mitigation:

- Develop an incident response plan with clear response actions.
- Conduct forensic analysis and investigation.
- Communicate with stakeholders and customers.

### Recover
Recovery measures include:

- Implementing a data backup and recovery plan.
- Conducting post-incident analysis.
- Strengthening cybersecurity policies to prevent recurrence.

This comprehensive cybersecurity roadmap enhances Latitude Financial Services' ability to withstand cyber threats and ensures business resilience.

## How Latitude Could Have Avoided the Data Breach
The Latitude data breach could have been avoided if the company had implemented the NIST cybersecurity framework with the following controls:

- **Access Control:** Latitude should have implemented stronger access control measures to prevent unauthorized users from accessing its systems. This could have included implementing multi-factor authentication and restricting access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only.

- **Incident Detection Implementation:** Latitude should have implemented some incident detection implementation and SIEM to detect any incident or malicious file from infecting its systems.

- **Vendor Management:** By assessing and ongoing monitoring third-party vendors, Latitude might be able to identify some anomalies from the vendors and therefore have appropriate responses to prevent the incident.

- **Data Encryption:** This could have included encrypting customer data at rest and in transit, and be a further step for preventing Latitude from having their data accessed and exploited by unauthorized users.

- **Incident Response and Recovery Plan:** Latitude should have had an appropriate incident response and recovery plan in place to respond to cybersecurity incidents in a timely and effective manner. This plan should have included procedures for identifying, containing, and remediating cybersecurity incidents and recovering after the attack with a specific timeline. Based on how Latitude responded to the data breach, it could be seen that its late response and communication to stakeholders have significantly impacted the company’s reputation and therefore influenced the business.

- **Additional Preventative Measures:**
  - Conducting regular security assessments to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
  - Training employees on cybersecurity best practices, such as password security, phishing scams, and social engineering.
  - Encouraging a positive workforce culture where employees promptly report security incidents.

By implementing these measures, Latitude Financial Services could have significantly reduced the likelihood and impact of the data breach.
