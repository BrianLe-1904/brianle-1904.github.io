- **SIEM & SOAR Integration**: Learned how to configure Wazuh and Shuffle to work together, enhancing real-time alert processing and response actions.
- **Incident Response Automation**: Developed skills in automating common response tasks, such as IP blocking, alert escalation, and email notifications, which are crucial for managing high-volume security alerts in a SOC environment.
- **Scripting and Configuration Management**: Practiced editing configuration files, managing permissions, and using scripting to facilitate seamless tool interoperability, especially within Linux environments.
- **Regex & Hash Parsing**: Utilized regex techniques for parsing threat intelligence data, such as extracting hashes from alerts, and integrated VirusTotal for reputation checking.
- **User Interaction in Automated Workflows**: Implemented conditional decision-making within workflows, allowing analysts to interact with the system for specific responses, such as blocking IPs.


### Tools Used
- **Wazuh**: Employed as the central SIEM tool for log management, threat detection, and alert generation, configured to monitor and capture events like Mimikatz usage.
- **TheHive**: Used for incident tracking, case management, and threat analysis, enabling structured response to alerts generated by Wazuh.
- **Shuffle**: A SOAR platform used to automate response actions based on incoming alerts from Wazuh, allowing integration with external tools such as VirusTotal and email.
- **VirusTotal**: Utilized for hash reputation analysis, providing quick context on potential malware by evaluating SHA-256 hashes flagged in alerts.
- **DigitalOcean**: Hosted Wazuh and TheHive servers as well as network firewall configurations to manage traffic between security platforms.
- **Ubuntu & Windows 11 Virtual Machines on UTM**: Simulated real-world environments for generating telemetry data and testing automated workflows across different operating systems.
- **Regex**: Applied in Shuffle for parsing alert data, particularly useful for extracting critical information such as file hashes from Wazuh alerts.
- **Email Notification Services**: Enabled automated alerts to be sent to SOC analysts for high-priority events, ensuring timely incident response.

## Steps

### Step 1: Creating a SOC Automated Project Diagram
The first step in building a Security Operations Center (SOC) automation project is to create a clear visual diagram that outlines the flow of data and interaction between key components: Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle (Figure 1 & 2). This diagram will serve as a blueprint, focusing on the automation workflow and data paths to facilitate case management and alert response.

(Figure 2)

#### A. Core Diagram Components

The emphasis should be on functionality rather than aesthetics. Each component represents a specific function within the SOC automation project:
- **PC Icon**: Represents a Windows 10 client with the Wazuh agent installed to simulate data flow from an endpoint.
- **Router Icon**: Depicts the network connection between the various components.
- **Cloud Icon**: Denotes internet resources and cloud-hosted services integrated within the project.
- **Windows 11 Client**: Endpoint device generating event data.
- **Internet (Cloud)**: Represents external internet and cloud services.
- **Wazuh Manager**: SIEM component for event collection and alert generation.
- **TheHive**: Centralised case management system.
- **Shuffle**: SOAR platform for orchestration and response.
- **SOC Analyst**: Person receiving and acting on alerts.

#### B. Establishing Workflow Steps

- **Step 1**: Windows 11 client sends events to Wazuh Manager.
- **Step 2**: Wazuh Manager collects events.
- **Step 3**: Wazuh Manager forwards alerts to Shuffle (color-coded arrow for distinction).
- **Step 4**: Shuffle enriches alerts with open-source intelligence for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Step 5**: Enriched alerts are sent from Shuffle to TheHive for case management.
- **Step 6**: Shuffle emails the SOC Analyst about high-priority events.
- **Step 7**: The SOC Analyst receives the alert email.
- **Step 8**: The SOC Analyst initiates a response action as necessary.

- The SOC Analyst’s response is sent back to Shuffle, which forwards the action to Wazuh Manager for execution.
- Wazuh Manager then coordinates with the Windows 11 client to execute the required response action based on the SOC Analyst's input.

### Step 2: Project Setup

#### A. Virtual Machine (VM) Creation
- Created a Windows 11 virtual machine on Mac M1 to simulate a Windows environment for security monitoring. Due to the lack of compatibility coming from the M1 chip with Windows 11 ISO files, CrystalFetch and UTM are used as a VM host (Figure 3).
- Installed Sysmon on Windows 11 virtual machine and ensured the service was active and running.

(Figure 3)

#### B. DigitalOcean Configuration
- Set up two cloud droplets on Digital Ocean for hosting Wazuh and The Hive instances (Figure 4)
- Configured firewall rules to control access (Figure 5):
  - Inbound Rules: Allowed TCP and UDP traffic only from my IP address (61.69.236.165) for secure and limited access.
  - Outbound Rules: No changes; kept the default settings to ensure general outbound connectivity.

### Step 4: Generating Telemetry and Configuring Alerts 

**Access Wazuh Configuration**
   - Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent`.
   - Open the `ossec.conf` configuration file using Notepad (run as an administrator if necessary).
   - This file includes Wazuh's settings for log analysis and event handling.

**Modify Log Analysis Settings**
   - In the "Log Analysis" section, find event IDs marked for exclusion (indicated by `!=`).
   - Copy an existing line to customize settings for monitoring PowerShell and Mimikatz-related processes.

**Configure Sysmon Integration**
   - Created a backup (e.g., rename it `ossec_backup.conf`).
   - Reopened the file and add a specific tag for Sysmon logs, modifying an existing tag to reference Sysmon’s event channel from Windows Event Viewer.

**Streamline Log Forwarding**
   - Optionally, removed forwarding settings for less relevant logs (Application, Security, and System logs) if focusing on Sysmon logs only.
   - Saved the configuration changes.

**Restart Wazuh Service**
   - Went to Services and restart the Wazuh service to activate the new configurations.
   - Navigated to Wazuh dashboard under "Agent" to add new agent (Windows 11 Virtual Machine)


**Download and Prepare Mimikatz**
   - Downloaded Mimikatz and adjust Windows Defender settings to exclude the Downloads folder (to prevent file interference).
   - If needed, adjusted Google Chrome’s security settings to enable the download.
   - Extracted Mimikatz for testing.

**Run Mimikatz**
   - Opened an administrator PowerShell session, navigate to the Mimikatz directory, and execute `mimikatz.exe`.
<img width="717" alt="step 4b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c905b315-6d1e-4846-a9f0-2cdf5ee0cbd4">

**Check for Mimikatz Events in Wazuh Dashboard**
   - Searched for Mimikatz-related events in the Wazuh dashboard.
   - If no events appear, check that logging settings are properly configured, as Wazuh may only log events that trigger specific alerts by default.

**Update Wazuh Configuration for Comprehensive Logging**
    - Backed up the `ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh manager.
    - Opened `ossec.conf` and set `log_all` and `log_all_json` to "yes" to enable logging for all events.
    - Restarted the Wazuh manager to apply these settings.

**Configure Filebeat**
    - Updated the Filebeat configuration to allow ingestion of archived logs.
    - Restarted the Filebeat service to implement changes.

**Set Up a New Index in Wazuh**
    - In the Wazuh dashboard, navigated to Stack Management, and create a new index pattern to monitor archived logs.

**Verify Log Ingestion**
    - Allowed some time for log ingestion, then check the dashboard for Mimikatz events.
    - If events were not visible, troubleshooted by checking archive files directly.

**Create a Custom Alert Rule in Wazuh**
    - Use Wazuh’s built-in rules for reference.
    - Copy a Sysmon rule template (such as Event ID 1) and modify it to create a custom rule for detecting Mimikatz by its executable name.
    - Pay attention to proper syntax and case sensitivity when creating the rule.

**Test the Custom Alert**
    - Renamed `mimikatz.exe` to an alternative name (e.g., "brianistryinghisbest.exe").
    - Run the renamed file, then check the Wazuh dashboard for any triggered alerts.

#### F. User Input for Blocking IPs (to be updated)

**User Decision Step:**
- Added a user input step in Shuffle to allow analysts to decide on IP blocking.
  
**Active Response Configuration:**
- Configured Wazuh’s active response to act on analyst decisions to block IPs.
<img width="931" alt="step 5 last" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7b09b1-1fbe-4139-a448-37d14513387b">

### Step 6: Testing and Further Directions
- Verified the entire workflow by generating alerts and confirming that each step—alert detection, data parsing, VirusTotal checks, The Hive alert creation, and email notifications—was functioning as expected.
- Further direction will try to implement SOC Automation on different OS such as Ubuntu machines or Linux. Further implementing different tools for more dynamic approaches such as Splunk.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my skills in cybersecurity monitoring, configuration management, automation, and incident response. By automating alert handling and response actions, I effectively reduced the manual workload for analysts and created a streamlined workflow for threat detection and mitigation. This SOC automation setup reflects a deep understanding of security operations and serves as a scalable, hands-on demonstration of my capabilities as a SOC analyst.
