# AI in Cybersecurity: Poisoning Attacks in Machine Learning

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning (ML), has seen significant growth and recognition, bringing numerous benefits to everyday life. However, with these advancements come new security threats, specifically poisoning attacks on machine learning models. Poisoning attacks involve adversaries intentionally manipulating training data to compromise model integrity, leading to incorrect or biased predictions. These attacks can have serious consequences in critical applications like network security, financial fraud detection, and autonomous driving. This report provides a comprehensive review of poisoning attacks in machine learning, including their impact, evolution, and mitigation strategies to secure ML models effectively.

## Poisoning Attacks on Machine Learning
Poisoning attacks manipulate the data used for training ML models, leading to biased or erroneous outcomes. Attackers inject malicious data into the training set, causing the model to learn incorrect patterns. These attacks can significantly impact critical systems, such as smart city applications, where the integrity of ML models is essential for decision-making processes.

## Evolution of Poisoning Attacks
### Data Poisoning Attacks
Adversaries intentionally corrupt training datasets to influence ML models toward malicious objectives. This can be done through insider threats or external interference, leading to incorrect classifications and compromised security systems.

### Software Poisoning Attacks
Hackers infiltrate ML infrastructure, altering software frameworks or training components to introduce vulnerabilities. This method can enable unauthorized access and control, affecting model reliability.

### Model Poisoning Attacks
These attacks target the integrity of trained ML models by manipulating parameters or structure post-training, resulting in adversarial behavior. Attackers can subtly alter models to misclassify sensitive data, compromising system security.

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
DoS attacks aim to overwhelm systems with excessive traffic, disrupting normal operations. In smart city environments, such attacks can affect IoT devices and communication networks, impairing critical infrastructure functionality.

### Label Flipping Attacks
In these attacks, adversaries modify data labels to cause misclassification, reducing model performance and reliability. Label flipping is particularly dangerous in cybersecurity, healthcare, and financial systems.

### Backdoor Attacks
Attackers implant hidden patterns in training data that remain dormant until triggered. Once activated, these backdoors cause models to behave unpredictably, allowing unauthorized access or bypassing security measures.

### Availability Attacks
Availability attacks corrupt ML models, leading to widespread misclassification. These attacks affect model performance on most testing samples, severely impacting model reliability.

### Targeted and Subpopulation Attacks
Targeted attacks focus on specific testing samples while preserving performance on others, making detection challenging. Subpopulation attacks selectively affect a particular subset of data, leading to misclassification while maintaining overall model accuracy.

## Mitigation Strategies
### Authentication and Provenance
A cryptographic approach to authentication and provenance ensures data integrity throughout the training process. This strategy helps prevent software and model poisoning by verifying component authenticity.

### Privacy-Preserving Frameworks
Blockchain-based frameworks enhance data security, integrating privacy mechanisms and intrusion detection systems to guard against data manipulation.

### Fully-Agnostic Detection Framework
Comprehensive frameworks analyze datasets for contamination by comparing classifier accuracy on tainted and clean data. These detection mechanisms enhance adaptability against various poisoning attacks.

### Adversarial Training
By exposing ML models to adversarial examples during training, this approach improves model resilience against poisoning attacks. Training diverse classifiers enhances detection and removal of compromised data samples.

## Discussion
The landscape of poisoning attacks continues to evolve, presenting ongoing challenges for cybersecurity. While mitigation strategies have advanced, they introduce new challenges such as computational overhead and scalability concerns. Continuous research and development are essential to address these evolving threats effectively.

## Conclusion
Poisoning attacks in machine learning pose significant risks, necessitating the development of adaptive and robust defense mechanisms. Understanding attack methodologies and implementing effective mitigation strategies are crucial to ensuring ML model security. Future research should focus on scalable and efficient solutions to counteract these evolving threats.
