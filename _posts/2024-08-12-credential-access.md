# Credential Access: Stealing Web Session Cookies

## Introduction

Stealing web session cookies is a critical cyber-attack technique that exploits web-based authentication mechanisms. A session cookie is a small piece of data stored in a user's browser, allowing them to remain authenticated within a web application. If stolen, an attacker can impersonate the user without requiring their login credentials, granting unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive data.

This write-up examines the techniques used to steal web session cookies and outlines defensive strategies aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The framework's five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—serve as a structured roadmap for mitigating this threat.

## Stealing Web Session Cookies Techniques

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Attackers inject malicious scripts into a legitimate web application, allowing them to steal session cookies when unsuspecting users interact with the compromised page. If cookies lack security attributes such as `HttpOnly`, they can be easily accessed and transmitted to an attacker-controlled server.

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
By intercepting traffic over insecure networks, attackers can capture session cookies transmitted without encryption (e.g., via HTTP rather than HTTPS). Public Wi-Fi networks are common attack surfaces for session hijacking.

### 3. Session Hijacking
If web applications do not enforce strong session management, attackers can maintain access to compromised accounts for extended periods. Poor session expiration policies and failure to regenerate session IDs after login or privilege escalation increase the risk of exploitation.

## Defence Strategies (Aligned with NIST)

### **Identify**
- Conduct asset inventories to document all systems relying on session cookies.
- Perform regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities in session management.
- Audit session cookies for missing security attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).

### **Protect**
- Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on all session cookies to prevent client-side access and enforce encrypted transmission.
- Implement session expiration policies to limit the lifespan of cookies.
- Regenerate session tokens after critical actions, such as login or privilege escalation.
- Educate users on secure browsing practices, including VPN usage on public networks.

### **Detect**
- Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic for anomalies.
- Utilize behavioral analytics to flag unusual session activity, such as logins from unrecognized devices or geographic locations.
- Enforce session timeout policies to automatically log users out after periods of inactivity.

### **Respond**
- Implement an incident response plan to revoke compromised session cookies and force user reauthentication.
- Conduct forensic analysis to determine the attack method and affected systems.
- Isolate compromised accounts and prevent further unauthorized access.

### **Recover**
- Restore affected systems and patch vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
- Review session management policies and update security measures accordingly.
- Conduct post-incident evaluations to enhance future security practices.

## Conclusion

Session cookie theft poses a significant cybersecurity threat, potentially leading to data breaches, account compromise, and financial fraud. By aligning security measures with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, organizations can implement a multi-layered defense strategy to mitigate this risk. Identifying vulnerabilities, securing session management, detecting suspicious activity, responding effectively to incidents, and continuously improving security posture are essential steps in protecting against this attack vector. Adopting a proactive approach ensures stronger cyber resilience against session hijacking and related threats.
