## üå± Brief Introduction
As a soon-to-be graduate in Cybersecurity with a focus on Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis, I am passionate about defending networks from cyber threats and am eager to begin my career on the front lines of digital security. My training has equipped me with a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, particularly in monitoring, threat intelligence, and incident response. Through hands-on experience with SIEM technologies and vulnerability management tools, I have developed the analytical skills needed to assess and escalate security incidents in real-time.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong collaborative and communication skills, allowing me to work effectively within a team and interface with clients. Committed to continuous learning, I am excited about opportunities to further develop my knowledge and skills, including completing certifications like CompTIA CySA+ and advanced Blue Team training. I am driven by the challenge of staying at the forefront of cyber defense, working to identify and address threats before they impact the organizations I serve.

## üî≠ Objective
To secure a challenging position as a Level 1 SOC Analyst where I can apply my cybersecurity knowledge and technical skills to proactively monitor, detect, and respond to security threats. I aim to leverage my hands-on experience with SIEM and vulnerability management tools, along with my commitment to continuous learning, to protect client networks and contribute effectively to a dynamic Security Operations Center team. Eager to complete advanced certifications and deepen my expertise, I am dedicated to growing within a forward-thinking organization that values information security and professional development.
